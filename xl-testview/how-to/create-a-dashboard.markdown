Before you can create a dashboard in XL TestView, you must have [test specifications](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-test-specification.html) and [reports](/xl-testview/concept/reports.html) configured.

To create a new dashboard:

1. Click **Dashboards** in the top navigation bar.
2. Click **Add a dashboard**.
2. Enter a unique and descriptive name for the dashboard in the **Name** box.
3. The dashboard will periodically reload to show new test results (unless you select a specific date range in the past). Enter the number of seconds that XL TestView should wait between reloads in the **Reload interval** box.
4. If you want to base the new dashboard on an existing dashboard, select the dashboard to use from the **Duplicate** list.
