In XL TestView, you can import test results in TRX format generated by:

* Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)
* VSTest.console
* MSTest 

To import TRX results, [create a test specification](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-test-specification.html) and select the `xlt.TRX` test tool. If you are using the [import wizard](/xl-testview/how-to/import-test-results.html), choose `TRX (mstest, vstest.console, TFS)` in the test tool step.

For information about generating TRX files, refer to:

* [VSTest.console](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj155796.aspx)
* [MSTest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182489.aspx)

## Considerations

* You must supply XL TestView with the TRX files. You should configure TFS to generate TRX files or manually use VSTest.console/MSTest for this.

* TRX files should be in a fixed directory. This directory should be cleaned before each build and must not contain results from a previous build.
