You can import test results in the TRX file format, generated by **Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)**, **VSTest.console** or **MSTest**, into XL TestView. 

In order to import these results, create a test specification and select the test tool `xlt.TRX`. If you're using the import wizard, choose `TRX (mstest, vstest.console, TFS)` in the test tool screen.

This document lists several important considerations when importing TRX files into XL TestView.

For reference on how to generate TRX files, please see the following:

* [VSTest.console](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj155796.aspx)
* [MSTest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182489.aspx)

## Considerations
1) You will need to supply XL TestView with the TRX files. You should either configure TFS to generate TRX files, or manually use VSTest.console/MSTest for this.

2) The TRX files should be in a fixed directory. This folder should be cleaned before each build and must not contain results from a previous build.
