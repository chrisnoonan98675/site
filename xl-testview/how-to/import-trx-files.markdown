In XL TestView, you can import test results in TRX format generated by:

* Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)
* VSTest.console
* MSTest

For information about generating TRX files, refer to:

* [VSTest.console](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj155796.aspx)
* [MSTest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182489.aspx)

After [creating a test specification](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-test-specification.html) with the `xlt.TRX` test tool results can be imported in the usual ways:

* The Jenkins plugin
* Import from a location via an Active Test Specification
* Upload via the [REST API](/xl-testview/latest/rest-api/)

## Integrating with TFS

The best options until we provide a TFS plugin are:

* upload results via the REST API in the build
* pick them up from a fixed directory on a server

On TFS 2015 it should be mostly straightforward to configure a task that or invokes an upload using REST or copy the files to a fixed location where they can be picked up via an Active Test Specification.

On version prior to TFS 2015 it may be a challenge to get to the TRX files.

When using the Active Test Specification approach care should be taken to clear the directory where the results are stored between runs. This to prevent problems with uploading stale results.
