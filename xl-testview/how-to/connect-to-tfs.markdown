In XL TestView, you can import test results in TRX format generated by:

* Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)
* VSTest.console
* MSTest

**Note:** XL TestView does not have a TFS plugin, so integration with TFS is currently limited.

After [creating a test specification](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-test-specification.html) that is configured for the `xlt.TRX` test tool, you can import results TFS in two ways:

* Import results from a fixed location via an [active test specification](/xl-testview/concept/key-concepts.html#test-specifications)
* Upload results via the [REST API](/xl-testview/latest/rest-api/)

In TFS 2015, you can configure a task or invoke an upload using REST or copy files to a fixed location where they can be picked up via an active test specification. In earlier versions of TFS, it may be more difficult to get TRX files.

When using the active test specification approach, ensure that you clear the directory where results are stored between test runs. This prevents problems with uploading stale results.
