We do not provide a TFS plugin yet so the integration with TFS is not optimal.

In XL TestView, you can import test results in TRX format generated by:

* Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS)
* VSTest.console
* MSTest

After [creating a test specification](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-test-specification.html) configured for the `xlt.TRX` test tool, results can be imported from TFS in two ways:

* import from a fixed location via an Active Test Specification
* upload via the [REST API](/xl-testview/latest/rest-api/)

On TFS 2015 it should be mostly straightforward to configure a task that or invokes an upload using REST or copy the files to a fixed location where they can be picked up via an Active Test Specification.

On version prior to TFS 2015 it may be a challenge to get to the TRX files.

When using the Active Test Specification approach care should be taken to clear the directory where the results are stored between runs. This to prevent problems with uploading stale results.
