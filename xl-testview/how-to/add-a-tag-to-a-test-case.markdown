On the [flakiness report](/xl-testview/concept/reports.html#flakiness-overview) and on the [test case details screen](/xl-testview/how-to/view-test-case-details.html), you can add tags to or remove tags from specific runs of test cases.

On the flakiness report:

1. Click the run of the test that you want to tag.
2. Click **+** in the test details pane.
3. Type the name of the tag and press ENTER. If the tag already exists, XL TestView will suggest it as you type.

In this example, the **FrontEnd** tag has just been added:

![Adding tags to test cases](images/tag-add-tag-to-test-case.png)

To remove a tag from a test, click the **X** next to the tag.
