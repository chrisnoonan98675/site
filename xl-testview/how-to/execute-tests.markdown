*Executable* test specifications can be run from XL TestView. This will execute the tests on the local or a remote system and import the new test results. To execute a test specification:

1. Click **Projects** in the top menu bar.
1. Click the project that contains the test specification that you want to execute.
1. Click **Execute** next to the test specification. Note that this option is only available for *executable* specifications.
1. If required, fill in the execution properties.
1. XL TestView executes the command and shows the progress in a progress bar. 

    **Note:** The first time you execute the specification, the progress bar will not be accurate because XL TestView does not yet have historical data about the run time.

1. After execution is complete, click **Show report** to see the results.
