To filter a report by tag, start typing the tag name in the **Filter by tag** box. When the suggested tag appears, press ENTER or TAB to add it to the filter.

For example, this report is filtered by one tag:

You can add more tags to the filter by entering them in the box. This report is filtered by two tags:

To remove a tag from the filter, click the X next to the tag.

Some reports, such as the [flakiness report](/xl-testview/concept/reports.html#flakiness-overview) and the [test case details](/xl-testview/how-to/view-test-case-details.html) allow you to [add tags yourself](/xl-testview/how-to/add-a-tag-to-a-test-case.html).
