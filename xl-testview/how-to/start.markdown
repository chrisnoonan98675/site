To start XL TestView:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to `XL_TESTVIEW_HOME/bin`, where `XL_TESTVIEW_HOME` is the directory where XL TestView is installed (for example, `/opt/xebialabs/xl-testview` or `C:\Program Files\XL TestView`).
1. Execute one of the following commands to start the setup wizard:
      * On a Unix-based operating system: `server.sh`
      * On Microsoft Windows: `server.cmd`
1. After XL TestView has started, you will see the message `Starting XL TestView ... done.` and the URL where you can access XL TestView.

Alternatively, run the XL TestView server [as a service](/xl-testview/how-to/install-xl-testview-as-a-service.html).
