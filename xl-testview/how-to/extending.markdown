You can extend XL TestView's functionality in several ways:

* By creating [custom test result parsers](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-test-results-parser.html) that import data from test tools and in formats that XL TestView does not support by default

* By creating [custom reports](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-report.html) to display information that you are interested in

* By creating [custom qualifications](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-qualification.html) to make automated go/no-go decisions based on test results

For information about XL TestView's integration points, refer to:

* [REST API reference](/xl-testview/latest/rest-api/index.html)
