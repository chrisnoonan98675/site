XL TestView can be extended in multiple ways:

* By adding [test result parsers](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-test-results-parser.html) that import data from test tools not supported by default
* By adding [reports](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-report.html) to display the information of your interest
* By adding [qualifications](/xl-testview/how-to/create-a-custom-qualification.html) to make automated go/no go decisions based on test results

XL TestView includes the following interfaces for extending its functionality:

To interact with XL TestView from other tools, refer to the [XL TestView REST API reference](/xl-testview/latest/rest-api/index.html).

To extend XL TestView with custom test result parsers consult the [XL TestView Jython API reference](/xl-testview/latest/jython-api/index.html).
