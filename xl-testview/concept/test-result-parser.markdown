A test result parser is a small program that reads the files produced by a [test tool](xl-testview/concept/key-concepts.html#test-tools), and produces individual test results (called [events](/xl-testview/concept/events.html)) that are stored by XL TestView. A test result parser is written in Python and is executed by XL TestView.
