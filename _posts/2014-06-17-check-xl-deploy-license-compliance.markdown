You can use [this script](user_compliance.txt) to verify your XL Deploy license compliance on Unix systems. Place the script in the `<XLDEPLOY_HOME>/log` directory and execute it. It will report the number of users that have used XL Deploy on a monthly basis.

**Note:** In XL Deploy 4.5.2 and later, the number of users is shown in **Help** > **About**.
