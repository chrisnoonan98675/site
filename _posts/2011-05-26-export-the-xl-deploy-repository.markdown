When moving data from one XL Deploy installation to another, you would want to move the contents of your repository as well. You can use [this XL Deploy command-line interface (CLI) script](https://github.com/xebialabs/community-plugins/tree/master/cli-scripts/repository-export) from the community repository to export the contents of your repository.
