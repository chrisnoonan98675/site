title: Navigation beta

This page exists to gather feedback on a new way of organizing and navigating the technical documentation. To get started, expand items in the menu on the left.

Note that most links in the menu don't work; it's a prototype to show you the proposed approach.

## Background information

In December 2014, we launched a new version of the documentation site, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and based on [topics](http://techwhirl.com/getting-started-with-topic-based-writing/) instead of manuals. In the subsequent two years, we've learned that while this implementation provides many benefits, there's still room to improve. Some goals are to:

* Ensure that the user sees overview and getting started information as early as possible
* Guide the user through the business goals they want to achieve
* Make documentation about plugins and APIs more visible
* Consolidate pieces of information that the user may need at the same time

And on the back end:

* Make it easier to control the structure of the site menu
* Eliminate manual work required to maintain index pages and redirects
* Reduce the time required to generate the site so local editing is easier

To achieve these goals, I:

* Changed the sidebar into a multi-level menu that provides access to all site content
* Organized conceptual information and low-level tasks under high-level business goals
* Combined related information from multiple places into longer, more comprehensive topics

Please take a look, think about the questions below, and drop me an email with your feedback at [ajohnston@xebialabs.com](mailto:ajohnston@xebialabs.com).

## General questions

* How inconvenient would it be for you — and for the users you know — if some existing URLs started returning 404 errors?
* If you followed an old link that returned a 404 error, would this type of navigation would help you find the information that you were looking for?

## Navigation questions

While looking at the menu, please consider:

* Does the organization of menu and submenu items make sense to you?
    * Are menu items too granular? Not granular enough?
    * Does the order of menu items seem logical?
* Would a menu like this help you navigate the documentation site?

## Page questions

Locate the following pages:

* For XL Release: **Working with phases and tasks**
* For XL Deploy: **Using placeholders and dictionaries**
* For XL TestView: **Create custom reports**

Please consider:

* Could you easily find these pages in the sidebar menu?
* Can you navigate within the page itself?
* Do you have a sense of where you are within the structure of the page?
* Is the table of contents (at the top right of the page) useful? Is it too granular?
* Does the URL of the page make sense?
