Everything you ever wanted to know and never dared to ask.

### Loading test results

In order to get started with your own test results you need to have a software project set up on
your computer, a remote computer, or a Jenkins server. Launch the import wizard by clicking **Get started** on the welcome screen
or by clicking **Import** in the top navigation.

XL Test provides support for the following tooling out of the box:

* **FitNesse**: The importer reads the test results. FitNesse suites must be executed by FitNesse itself, not through its jUnit runner.
* **Cucumber**: Cucumber javascript reports.
* **Gatling**: Performance test results.
* **xUnit**: Many test tools produce some sort of jUnit-like output. Note that this is a sparse output format.

If none of the tools listed above suites your needs, please drop us a mail via the **I can't find my tool** option.
