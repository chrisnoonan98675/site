XL Test's configurable qualification possibilities allow for seamless integration with a continuous delivery pipeline. XL Test automatically analyzes the test results that are available within XL Test using the specified configuration algorithm. In this way, XL Test supports tailored automated go/no go decision-making.

The icon to the left of a test specification on the Test specifications screen shows whether the qualification of the most recent execution is positive or negative.
