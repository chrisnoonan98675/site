To start XL Test:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to `XLTEST_HOME/bin`, where `XLTEST_HOME` is the directory where XL Test is installed (for example, `/opt/xebialabs/xl-test` or `C:\Program Files\XL Test`).
1. Execute one of the following commands to start the setup wizard:
      * On a Unix-based operating system: `server.sh`
      * On Microsoft Windows: `server.cmd`
1. After XL Test has started, you will see the message `Starting XL Test ... done.` and the URL where you can access XL Test.
