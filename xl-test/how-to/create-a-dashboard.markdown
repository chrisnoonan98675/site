Before you can create a dashboard in XL Test, you must have test specifications and reports configured.

To create a new dashboard:

1. Click **Dashboards** in the navigation bar.
2. Click **Add a dashboard**.
2. Enter a unique and descriptive name for the dashboard in the **Name** box.
3. The dashboard will periodically reload to show new test results. Enter the number of seconds that XL Test should wait between reloads in the **Reload interval** box.
4. If the dashboard should be based on an existing dashboard, select the dashboard to use from the **Duplicate** list.
