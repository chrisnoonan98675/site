Each goal view in XL Impact includes key performance indicators (KPIs) that tell the data story of project progress for the selected goal. These KPIs are labeled as section titles on the goal view in the XL Impact user interface.

SCREENSHOT

As DevOps is about organizational, cultural, and behavioral change, measuring impact requires in-depth analysis, combining data outputs showing development metrics into a complex picture of team, department, or organizational action. To support this complex understanding, each KPI within the XL Impact goal views is divided into tiles that each show a specific metric from the integrated data sources, adding to the overall picture of goal progress.

## The three types of KPI tiles

* **Insights**

Insight Tiles use numerical trend information (much of which is shown on metric tiles) to provide an overall summary or other suggestions about the release process in written language. These tiles provide quick and easily understandable overviews to users as well as helping them shape targeted actions through their suggestions.

* **Metrics**

Metric Tiles show numerical information and the percent change for that number from the previous period. Metric tiles are helpful for users who want to see the information used to calculate trends, and to provide relevant data for outside discussions or to scope their understanding of the summaries (e.g., trend is good but there was only a change of 1 or 2 units).

* **Charts**

Charts visualize relevant data across time, letting the user zoom in and view a particular period within the context provided by the rest of the historical data visible in the mini-map. Charts are particularly helpful for visual learners to spot trends, and can be easily shared in presentations for impactful discussions of the data.
