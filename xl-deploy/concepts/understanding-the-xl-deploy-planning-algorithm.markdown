The planning [phase](the-deployment-process-from-package-to-deployment.html) takes place when the global structure of the deployment has been determined, and XL Deploy needs to fill in the steps needed to deploy the application.

The goal of planning is to generate a deployment plan. It uses the structured deployment generated by the [orchestration]() phase.

Xl Deploy generates a unique plan for every deployment.

## What does affect the final plan?
* The application, environment and mappings configured during specification
* The structuring performed by the orchestrators
* The Plugins and Planning rules
* *Use of staging and satellites* Staging and satellites will contribute steps to the plan.
* *Plan simplification* At the end of the planning phase, XL Deploy simplifies the plan so it is easier for you to visualise.
