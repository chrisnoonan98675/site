To remove the application and all of its components from an environment, you need to _undeploy_ the application:

1. Click **Deployment** in the top bar.
1. Locate the environment under **Deployed Applications**.
1. Expand the environment name, right-click the deployed application, and select **Undeploy**.
1. To view and/or edit the properties of a mapped deployable, select it and click ![Edit deployed](/images/button_edit_deployed.png), or double-click it.
1. Click **Next**. The undeployment plan appears.
1. Click **Execute** to execute the plan.
