To remove an application and its components from an environment, you need to _undeploy_ the application:

1. Click **Deployment** in the top bar.
1. Locate the environment under **Environments**.

    **Note:** In XL Deploy 4.5.x and earlier, this section is called **Deployed Applications**.

1. Expand the environment, right-click the deployed application, and select **Undeploy**.
1. Optionally select one or more orchestrators to use when executing the undeployment.
1. Click **Next**. The undeployment plan appears.
1. Click **Execute** to execute the plan.
