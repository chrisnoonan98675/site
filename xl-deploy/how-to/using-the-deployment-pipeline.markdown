In XL Deploy you can view the [deployment pipeline](/xl-deploy/concept/release-dashboard.html#define-a-deployment-pipeline) for an application or a deployment/provisioning package. This allows you to see which version of an application is deployed to each environment in the pipeline.

To view the deployment pipeline:

1. Expand **Applications** in the left pane.
1. Hover over the desired application, deployment package, or provisioning package, click ![Explorer action menu](/images/menu_three_dots.png), and then select **Deployment pipeline**.

A new tab appears in the right pane containing all the environments where the application is deployed.

**Note:** Click **Refresh** to retrieve the latest data from the server.

You can search for an environment by name in the deployment pipeline.
