## Using the XL Deploy Maven plugin

To enable continuous deployment, XL Deploy can be integrated with the Maven build system. The XL Deploy Maven plugin enables you to integrate Maven and XL Deploy. Specifically, the plugin supports:

* Creating a deployment package containing artifacts from the build
* Performing a deployment to a target environment
* Undeploying a previously deployed application

For more information, see [the XL Deploy maven plugin documentation](/xl-deploy/latest/maven-plugin/index.html).

## Using the Maven `jar` plugin

The standard maven `jar` plugin can also be used to create a XL Deploy package.

* Create a manifest file conforming to the XL Deploy manifest standard
* Create a directory structure containing the files as they should appear in the package

In the maven POM, configure the jar plugin as follows:

    <project>
      ...
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
            ...
            <configuration>
              <includes>
                <include>**/*</include>
              </includes>
            </configuration>
            ...
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
      ...
    </project>

The XL Deploy package can be generated by invoking the command:

    mvn package
