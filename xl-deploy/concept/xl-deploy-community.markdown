XL Deploy is used and implemented by people all over the world. The XL Deploy community enables knowledge sharing about implementation best practices and tips and tricks between users of the product.

## Community plugins

XL Deploy is a highly configurable product because different organizations all have different ways to perform deployments. Extensions to the XL Deploy product take the form of plugins that can be added to the base product to provide new capabilities. XL Deploy comes with several plugins out of the box.

In addition to the standard plugins, it is also possible to share plugins with other XL Deploy users. These community plugins are free to use and extend for all XL Deploy users.

For more information, see our [community plugins site](http://github.com/xebialabs/community-plugins).
