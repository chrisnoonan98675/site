The report shows the following columns:

* Application - The application on the environment.
* Version - The version of the application. 
* User - The user that performed the deployment.
* Date of Deployment - The date on which this version of the application was deployed.

**Note:** If you change the name of an application that was previously deployed, you will not be able to access detailed reports about that application.
