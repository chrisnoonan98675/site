When there is a problem with the Jackrabbit JCR repository underlying a XebiaLabs product (for example, the repository is corrupted), it may be useful to browse the repository contents using a repository browser tool. It is strongly recommended that you do so only with the assistance of the XebiaLabs Support Team.

If you encounter issues with the repository, please contact XebiaLabs at [https://support.xebialabs.com](https://support.xebialabs.com). The Support Team will investigate the issue and guide you through the use of a repository browser tool if it is needed.

**Note**: This does not apply for XL Release 7.5.0 and later.
