XL Deploy allows you to schedule or reschedule a task for execution at a specified date in time. Using the default GUI, you can schedule or reschedule tasks that are in a _PENDING_ or _SCHEDULED_ state.

If you are performing an initial deployment, an update deployment, an undeployment, or a rollback and you want to schedule the execution of the task at a specific time:

1. In the execution screen, click the arrow icon on the **Deploy**, **Undeploy**, or **Rollback** button and select **Schedule**.
1. In the Schedule screen, select the date and time that you want to execute the task. Specify the time using your local timezone.
1. Click **Schedule**.

**Note** You can also open and reschedule a task in _PENDING_ state from the list of deployment tasks in the Task Monitor. To cancel the task from the Task Monitor, click **Cancel task** or close the tab.
