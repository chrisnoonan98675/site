An environment is a grouping of infrastructure and middleware items such as hosts, servers, clusters, and so on. An environment is used as the target of a deployment, allowing you to map deployables to members of the environment.

To create an environment where you can deploy an application:

1. In the top bar, click **Explorer**.
1. Hover over **Environments**, click ![Menu button](/images/menu_three_dots.png), and select **New** >Right-click  and select **New** > **Environment**.
2. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the environment.
3. In the **Common** section, click in the **Containers** field, and select one or more middleware containers from the list.  
4. Click **Save**. 

**Tip:** To see a sample environment being created, watch the *[Defining environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU4NLPcCwlQ&list=PLIIv46GEoJ7ZvQd4BbzdMLaH0tc-gYyA1&index=3)* video.
