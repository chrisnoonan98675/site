You can configure the email notification preferences in XL Release by adding or removing events that trigger notifications and by modifying the roles that receive the email notifications.

To view or edit the default email notification settings, select **Settings** > **Notification settings** from the top menu.

There are two types of default notification events: at task level and at release level. For a more detailed description of the default notification events, refer to [Notifications in XL Release](/xl-release/concept/notifications-in-xl-release.html).

For each notification event, you can add or remove the roles and teams that receive email notifications.
To remove a role from a notification event, click the **x** next to the role name.
To add a new role, click in a row for a specific event, type the role name you want to add, and then click **Enter**.

The default roles are:

* Release Admin
* Task Owner
* Task Team

To edit the default notification email for a specific event, click **Edit message** for that event. You can customize the email template that will be sent when the notification event is triggered.

You can change the **Subject** and the body text of the email template.
Click the **High priority** checkbox to assign a high priority to the email notification.
