# Administrating the remote completion task

## Configuration

### SMTP
XL Release sends remote completion requests to users of the system by email. To configure the email server that is used to send these requests, select Settings > SMTP server from the top menu. 
The SMTP server page is only available to users who have the  _Admin_ [global permission](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/how-to/configure-permissions.html). For a more in detail explanation of how to setup an SMTP server see: [Configure SMTP server](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/how-to/configure-smtp-server.html)

### IMAP
XL Release fetches the remote completion emails send by users that want to complete or fail a remote completion task. To configure the email server that is used to receive the remote completion emails, 
select Settings > Shared configuration > Add IMAP server. The IMAP server settings is only available to users who have the _Admin_ [global permission](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/how-to/configure-permissions.html).

**Host** is used to specify the internet address of the mail server, followed by the **Port** it is listening on. Consult your system administrator on the values to use and whether to use **TLS** to secure the connection.

Use the **Username** and **Password** fields to set the credentials of the user that will connect. Make sure to setup a new email account especially for receiving remote completion emails. All existing emails can be deleted when you use an existing email account. The **From Address** is used as the email address that users reply to in order to remotely complete or fail a task. 
You must enter a valid email address. The **Enable whitelisting** field can be checked to enable whitelisting, then only emails to and from whitelisted domains will be processed for remote completion. 
The domains can be added using the **Domain whitelist** field. The **secret** field is used to generate an email signature that is used to verify that a received remote completion email hasnâ€™t been modified.

### xl-release.conf
Advanced configuration can be specified inside the xl-release.conf file located inside the conf folder from the XL Release server. The advanced configuration is used by the mail fetcher which processes incoming remote completion emails. 
The fetching of remote completion emails can be turned on or off using the **fetching-enabled** field. The **sync-interval** field specifies the interval time for the email fetcher. The **startup-delay** field specifies the initial startup delay of the mail fetcher.

## Auditing

Mailbox auditing can be turned on to log mailbox access by mailbox owners, delegates, and administrators. Inquire your mailbox provider how to setup mailbox auditing.

## Troubleshooting

### XL Release server

The XL Release server logging for the remote completion plugin can be turned on by adding the following line into the **logback.xml**: 
`<logger name="com.xebialabs.xlrelease.plugins.remotecompletion" level="info" />`
The basic flow of the remote completion process can be followed with log level **info**. The log level **debug** or even **trace** can be used for more detailed logging. 

### JavaMail
Inside the shell script to run the XL Release server, located in bin > run.sh add the following system property to the **$JAVACMD** to turn on session debugging: `-Dmail.debug=true`.
That will cause debug information to be printed to the console, including a protocol trace.

## Recommendations
- Enable whitelisting, then only emails to and from whitelisted domains will be processed for remote completion.
- To prevent any data leakage, ongoing and incoming emails should be encrypted. IMAP and SMTP protocols should be encrypted with SSL/TLS.
- Set up SMTP authentication to control user access.
- To prevent spamming, use content filters, enable DNS-based black lists (DNSBL) and SURBL (Spam URI Real-time Block Lists). Also maintain local blacklists of IP addresses of spam senders. Properly configure mail relay parameter of the email server to prevent open relay.
- Activate Reverse DNS to block bogus senders.
- Activate Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to prevent spoofed sources.
- Implement proactive measures to defend DoS and DDoS attack.
