In XL Release, go to **Settings** > **Task access** to restrict access to task types based on users' role.

![Task access](../images/task-access.png)

For each **Task type**, you can either:

* Select **Available for all users** if all users should be able to create or edit tasks of that type
* Specify the roles that have access to the task type under **Restricted to roles**

If you clear the **Available for all users** option and you do not add any roles, the task type will be unavailable to all users except those who have the *admin* permission.

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

To discard your changes without saving, click **Reset**.
