On the **Task access**, screen under **Settings**, you can restrict task types access to certain roles.

![Task access](../images/task-access.png)

For each **Task type**, you can set it to be either:

* **Available for all users**: all users can create or edit tasks based on this type.
* Or **Restricted to roles**: only the given roles have access to tasks based on this type.

If you uncheck **Available for all users** and don't list any roles, the task type will be disabled to all except users who have the **Admin** permission.

Click **Save** to apply your changes. Click **Reset** to discard your changes and reload the current settings from the server.
