In XL Release, you can restrict access to certain [task types](/xl-release/concept/types-of-tasks-in-xl-release.html) based on a user's [role](/xl-release/how-to/configure-roles.html). To configure task access, select **Settings** > **Task access** from the top menu.

For each **Task type**, you can either:

* Select **Available for all users** if all users should be able to create or edit tasks of that type
* Specify the roles that have access to the task type under **Restricted to roles**

If you clear the **Available for all users** option and you do not add any roles, the task type will be unavailable to all users except those who have the *admin* permission.

Click **Save** to apply your changes. To discard your changes without saving, click **Reset**.
