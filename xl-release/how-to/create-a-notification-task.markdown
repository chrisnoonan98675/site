The notification task allows you to write emails that are sent automatically when a task becomes active. This is an automated task, so it will complete by itself (or fail if the email could not be sent) and XL Release will advance to the subsequent task.

![Notification Task Details](../images/notification-task-details.png)

The options for the notification task are:

* **To**: A list of email addresses where the message will be sent.
* **Subject**: The subject of the message.
* **Body**: The message body, in plain text.

Click a field to edit it. You can use [variables](/xl-release/concept/variables-in-xl-release.html).
