The XL Release table view provides an alternative view of a template or release that is optimized for working with tasks. In table view, you can:

* Filter phases and tasks based on name, start date, end date, duration, type, and/or assignee
* Directly open a task by clicking its name
* Use the task action menu (![Task action menu](/images/menu_three_dots.png)) to quickly assign a task to yourself, change its type, duplicate it, or delete it

To access the table view, click **Table** at the top of the release flow page.
