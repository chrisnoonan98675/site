The XL Release table view provides an alternative view of a template or release that is optimized for working with tasks. In table view, you can:

* Filter phases and tasks based on name, start date, end date, duration, type, and/or assignee
* Directly open a task by clicking its name
* Use the task action menu (![Task action menu](/images/menu_three_dots.png)) to quickly assign a task to yourself, change its type, duplicate it, or delete it
* Perform actions on multiple tasks

You can select multiple tasks from the list and perform various actions. Click the **More actions** button and select an option from the list:
* Assign to - Assign the selected tasks to a user or team
* Delete - Delete the selected tasks
* Add comment - Add a comment on all the selected tasks
* Complete - Complete the selected tasks
* Skip - Skip the selected tasks
* Fail - Fail the selected tasks
* Retry - Retry the selected tasks

To access the table view, click **Table** at the top of the release flow page.
