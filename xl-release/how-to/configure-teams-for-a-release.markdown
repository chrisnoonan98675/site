In the release details, select **Teams** from the **Show** menu to go to the teams page, which shows the teams that are defined for the particular release.

Teams group people with the same role together. You can assign a task to a team to indicate that someone from the team must pick up the task when it becomes active. Release security permissions are also expressed on the team level; see [Release permissions](/xl-release/how-to/configure-permissions-for-a-release.html) for more information.

Click **New team** to add a new team to the release. Type each team member's name and press ENTER to add him or her to the team.

To remove a team, click the cross to the right of it.

There are two predefined teams (which you cannot remove):

* **Template Owner**: Contains everyone who has owning rights on the template.
* **Release Admin**: Contains everyone who is responsible for a running release that is created from this template. These are the people who receive extra notifications when, for example, a task fails and the release is halted.
