To see an overview of important information about a template or release, select **Release dashboard** from the **Show** menu. The release dashboard is a customizable view where you can add, configure, move, and remove tiles that show planning information and details about release status. For information about the tiles that are available, refer to [Overview of release summary tiles](/xl-release/concept/release-summary-tiles.html).
