## Release groups
By grouping releases together, you can manage a collection of releases together as one group. Releases can be added to multiple release groups, and into multiple folders. The release group feature also provides estimates on when the release group will start and finish, based on the schedule and other tasks that are being executing at the same time.

This screen shows all release groups based on status. From this screen, you can view start and end dates, completion status, duration, and the number of releases per group. You can also edit group details and delete groups.

### Release group flow screen
This screen shows detailed information on the releases that are in a release group. From this screen, you can add and remove releases, view the release group schedule, view planned and estimated completion dates. Selecting a release item in this screen will open the release flow screen for an individual release.
