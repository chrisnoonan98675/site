In the release details, select **Permissions** from the **Show** menu to go to the permissions page, where you specify who can do what on a release. This page is only available to users who have the 'edit security' permission, either on the release or as a [global permission](#global-permissions).

The following permissions apply to a release:

* **View Release**: Users have view access to this release. It will appear in the Release Overview. In the release details, users have read-only access to the release flow, properties, and activity log.
* **Edit Release**: Users can alter the structure of a release by adding and moving tasks and phases. Release properties and teams are editable.
* **Edit Security**: Users can edit teams and permissions in a release.
* **Start release**: Users can start a planned release.
* **Abort release**: Users can abort an active or planned release.
* **Edit task**: Users can edit individual tasks.
* **Reassign task**: Users can assign tasks to other people. Team assignment is also enabled.

The **Release Admin** team is created when the release is created. It contains the release owner and has all permissions by default.

Click **Save** to save your changes to the release permissions. Changes are not saved automatically.

To discard the changes that you've made without saving, click **Reset**.
