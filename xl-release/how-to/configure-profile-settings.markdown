The **Profile** page allows you to set your name, your email address, and your password.

![User Profile](../images/user-profile.png)

The email address is required to send notifications, such as when a task that is assigned to you starts.

When the XL Release server is configured to use your company's [LDAP directory](/xl-release/how-to/configure-ldap-security-for-xl-release.html), it will attempt to automatically find your name and your email address. You can change the name and address that the server has found.

*External* users cannot change their passwords from XL Release.
