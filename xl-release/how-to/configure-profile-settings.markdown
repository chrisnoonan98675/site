The email address is required to send [notifications](/xl-release/concept/notifications-in-xl-release.html), such as when a task that is assigned to you starts.

When the XL Release server is configured to use your company's [LDAP directory](/xl-release/how-to/configure-ldap-security-for-xl-release.html), it will attempt to automatically find your name and your email address. You can change the name and address that the server has found.

*External* users cannot change their passwords from XL Release.
