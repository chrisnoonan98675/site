To see an overview of all [active](/xl-release/concept/release-life-cycle.html) releases in XL Release, select **Releases** > **Pipeline** from the top bar. This page provides a pipeline view of each active release; it shows how much of each release has been completed and any flags that have been set on the release or tasks within it.

To filter the releases, click **Filter options** and select **Only my releases** and/or **Only flagged releases**. You can also filter by typing part of a release title or release tag in the box at the top of the page.

To drill down into a specific release, click its pipeline.
