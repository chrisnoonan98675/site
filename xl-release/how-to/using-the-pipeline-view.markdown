In XL Release, go to **Releases** > **Pipeline** to see an overview of all active releases, the phases they are in, and which tasks are currently active.

![Pipeline](../images/pipeline.png)

In the pipeline:

* Completed phases appear in gray
* Active phases show the task that is currently active
* Gate tasks appear in red; all others appear in light blue
* If a phase starts or ends with a gate that has not passed yet, it appears with the ![Gate icon](../images/gate-icon.png) icon
