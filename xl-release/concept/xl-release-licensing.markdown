You can download your license at the [XebiaLabs Software Distribution site](https://dist.xebialabs.com/).

## License types

When you log in to the [XebiaLabs Software Distribution site](https://dist.xebialabs.com/), you will see all of your current licenses. There are two versions of the XL Release license:

* **V1**: Required for XL Release 4.0.10 and earlier
* **V2**: Required for XL Release 4.0.11 through 4.7.x
* **V3**: Required for XL Release 4.8.0 and later

You can also find this information in the `README` file located with your licenses on the Software Distribution site.

To check the version of a license, open it in a text editor.

For information about installing the license, refer to [Install XL Deploy](/xl-deploy/how-to/install-xl-deploy.html#install-the-license).

## License validation

XL Release checks the validity of your license when you start the XL Release server and at certain times while the server is running.

The server will not start if a valid license is not installed.
