You can download your Enterprise Edition license at the [XebiaLabs Software Distribution site](https://dist.xebialabs.com/). When you log in to the site, you will see all of your current licenses. 

## License types

There are several versions of the XL Release license:

* **V1:** Required for XL Release 4.0.10 and earlier
* **V2:** Required for XL Release 4.0.11 through 4.7.x
* **V3:** Required for XL Release 4.8.0 and later

You can also find this information in the `README` file located with your licenses on the XebiaLabs Software Distribution site.

**Tip:** To check the version of a license (`.lic`) file, open it in a text editor.

## License installation

For information about installing the license, refer to [Install XL Release](/xl-release/how-to/install-xl-release.html#installing-the-license).

## License validation

XL Release checks the validity of your license when you start the XL Release server and at certain times while the server is running.

The server will not start if a valid license is not installed.

## License extension and renewal

To extend a Trial Edition license or to renew an Enterprise Edition license, [contact XebiaLabs](https://xebialabs.com/contact).
