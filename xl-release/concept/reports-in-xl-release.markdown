The reports screen shows graphs and statistics based on the historical release data present in the XL Release repository. It is accessible to users with the [view reports permission](/xl-release/how-to/configure-xl-release-permissions.html).

At the top of the page you can select the time period you are interested in: last 30 days, last 3 months, last 6 months, or range. In the range selection, you can also filter on dates using the **From** and **To** date selectors. The choice is reflected on all graphs and tables on the page.

The following types of reports are available: 

* [Dashboard](/xl-release/concept/dashboard-report.html)
* [Release automation report](/xl-release/concept/release-automation-report.html)
* [Release value stream report](/xl-release/concept/release-value-stream-report.html)
