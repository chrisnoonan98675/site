title: Install XL Release using a GUI installer
---

GUI installers are available for Microsoft Windows (EXE file) and OS X (DMG file). These will install XL Release as a service.

To use a GUI installer, double-click the file and follow the steps. After installation is complete, the installer will show the URL where you can access XL Release; for example, `http://localhost:5516`. When you open this URL in a browser, you will be prompted to enter your license key. You can then log in with the user name *admin* and the password that you provided during the setup process.

After installation is complete, you can configure XL Release startup options in the `XL_RELEASE_HOME/bin/xl-release-server.vmoptions` file.
