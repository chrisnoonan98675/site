## Release views

XL Release includes several release planning and management views to meet the needs of everyone who participates in the release process:

* The [pipeline view](/xl-release/how-to/using-the-pipeline-view.html) provides an overview of all active releases. It indicates the phase that each release is in and the tasks that are currently active.
* The [release flow editor](/xl-release/how-to/using-the-release-flow-editor.html) shows the phases and tasks in a template or release. This is the primary interface for adding, editing, moving, and grouping tasks.
* [Table view](/xl-release/how-to/using-the-table-view.html) shows the phases and tasks in a template or release in a tabular format that you can sort by properties such as task type, due date, and assignee (available in XL Release 5.0.0 and later).
* The [release planner](/xl-release/how-to/using-the-xl-release-planner.html) is an interactive Gantt chart that shows the timing of phases and tasks in a release.

### Using the pipeline view

To see an overview of all [active](/xl-release/concept/release-life-cycle.html) releases in XL Release, select **Releases** > **Pipeline** from the top bar. This page provides a pipeline view of each active release; it shows how much of each release has been completed and any flags that have been set on the release or tasks within it.
