## Template teams

In XL Release, a *release team* allows you to group users with the same role, so you can assign tasks in the release to the team. You can also configure template-level and release-level permissions on the team level. For information about teams, refer to [Configure release teams and permissions](/xl-release/how-to/configure-release-teams-and-permissions.html).

## Template permissions

_Template permissions_ determine who can do what in a release template.

To set template permissions, open a template and select **Permissions** from the **Show** menu. The Permissions page is only available to users who have the *Edit Security* permission on the template or who have the *Edit Security* [global permission](/xl-release/how-to/configure-permissions.html).

### Release permissions
