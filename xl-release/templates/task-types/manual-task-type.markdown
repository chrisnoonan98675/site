title: Manual task type
---

A Manual task represents a step in a template or release that must be completed by a person. It is the most basic type of task in XL Release.

Like other task types, you can assign Manual tasks to a single user or to a [release team](/xl-release/how-to/configure-teams-for-a-release.html).

In the [release flow editor](/xl-release/how-to/using-the-release-flow-editor.html), Manual tasks have a gray border.
