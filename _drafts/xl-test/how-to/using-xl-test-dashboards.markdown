A dashboard is the the primary way to quickly get an overview of the current status of your tests. You can create multiple dashboards, each with the information you want to see. The information on a dashboard is represented in *tiles*, which are small individual reports.

A dashboard has a view mode that shows information and an edit mode that enables you to alter the information shown.

XL Test includes a sample dashboard called *Demo Dashboard*. 

## See available dashboards

To see all available dashboards, click **Dashboards** in the top navigation bar.

For information about creating a new dashboard, refer to [link](/xl-test/how-to/create-a-dashboard.html).

## Working with view mode

The controls for a dashboard are in the header bar. The following controls are available:

* Dashboard dropdown: Select the different dashboards in XL Test
* Full screen: Only show the dashboard
* Edit dashboard: Modify the dashboard
* Date selector: Select the time period the dashboard shows:
    * Now: The current moment, which moves with the clock
    * A specific date: A fixed point in time
    * Range: The amount of time before the date point that is shown

For example, if the date is "now" and the range is five days, the dashboard will show test results for the past five days. This window will shift with time.

If the date is "20 Feb 2015" and the range is two weeks, the dashboard will show test results for the period of February 6 through February 20.

The date setting affects all tiles on the dashboard. Note that some reports only apply to a single moment in time, rather than to a time range. Those reports will show the most recent results.

## Working with edit mode

In edit mode, you can modify a dashboard, change its settings, and add and remove tiles.
