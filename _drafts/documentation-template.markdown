## File name

The file name format is `your-file-name-here.markdown`. Do not use underscores, spaces, or uppercase letters in the file name.

## Front matter

Do not change the words *title*, *categories*, *subject*, or *tags* in the font matter (for example, don't change *categories* to *category*).

### Title

Set `title` to the title of the page. Don't retype the title in the body of the post.

#### Formatting titles

Write the title in sentence case.

### Categories

Categories identity product(s) that the page applies to. They should be written as product IDs:

* xl-deploy
* xl-release
* xl-scale
* xl-test

You can add multiple categories.

#### Formatting categories

Write categories in lowercase.

### Subject

The subject is like a high-level tag. It helps users who are used to reading documentation in manuals. For example, you could create a topic that has the subject *Security* and the tags *password*, *ldap*, and *user management*.

You can only add one subject.

To see the subjects that are in use, go to [http://testdocs.xebialabs.com/tags-and-subjects.html](http://testdocs.xebialabs.com/tags-and-subjects.html).

#### Formatting the subject

Write the subject in sentence case.

### Tags

Tags help users browse posts and improve search results. Try to use tags that are already in use (see below for the lists). You can add new tags, but do so with caution.

You can add multiple tags.

To see the tags that are in use, go to [http://testdocs.xebialabs.com/tags-and-subjects.html](http://testdocs.xebialabs.com/tags-and-subjects.html).

#### Formatting tags

Tags must be written in lowercase. Spaces are allowed.

## Formatting the file

Refer to the readme of the online-docs-jekyll repository to see guidelines for formatting within the file.
