title: Real-Time, Customizable Release Notifications in v7.0
---

### You receive hundreds of emails daily. What do you do?

* Ignore them. There are too many to sort through and it’s overwhelming.
* Delete them or set an “auto-direct” rule in your inbox–and then never go back and check.
* Skip those “plain-text,” hard-to-comprehend emails and instead concentrate on high priority ones.
* Watch your spam folder fill up with emails that were not intended for you.
* All of the above.

**What if you could...**

Customize and configure the emails you and your team receive, based on events you need to know about? Customize the subject and body of emails to grab the attention of those who receive them? Communicate release status through your team’s chat software channels in real time, working in sync with their preferred way to stay in touch?
